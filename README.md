Tool available at [www.wesnothmoddingtool.com](www.wesnothmoddingtool.com)

It currently lets you make your own units, factions and eras having easy access to the default assets, looking to expand the tool to include campaing, translations anything that could be made easier while making wesnoth mods.

Feel free to make you additions to the tool! its a bit of spagueti code right now.
